# Analyzing the Impact of Vaccinations, Government Policy and Other Factors on the COVID-19 Pandemic
A repository containing my thesis and code I used to generate my thesis, with data and other relevant information TBA.

I am having some issues getting my data uploaded due to massive scope of it (~0.5 gigabytes total just for the final fully cleaned data I used to generate my model). I'll add it if I can find a solution, but in the mean time this data will be availble upon request.
